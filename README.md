# ContentCreatorWorkflow

This project uses n8n, AI script generation, and text-to-speech to produce fun, engaging explanations of complex academic concepts — read aloud in the voices of celebrities.

The result is an MP3 audio file of a chosen celebrity voice narrating a randomly selected academic topic in a lighthearted and approachable style.


# 🚀 How It Works

# Script Generation

n8n workflow generates a short script about an academic concept (random celebrity + random concept + random difficulty level if not specified), grading itself and revising the script continously until the quality reaches a certain threshold.

The scripts follow a structure and style that is emphasized in the GetBrandBrief workflow

The script mixes clarity with humor to make learning more engaging.


# Celebrity Voice Narration

The script output is configured by the Structued Output Parser node before being passed to ElevenLabs (AI voice service) for realistic speech synthesis.


# Final Output

An MP3 file is generated with the AI narration.


# 🎧 Example Outputs
Below are sample outputs generated by the workflows + ElevenLabs:

Kanye West on Dark Matter Theory
Steph Curry on the History of the Mona Lisa
Walter White on Combustion
LeBron James on Kinetic Energy


# ⚙️ Requirements

n8n
 (automation platform)

AI text generation service (OpenAI)

ElevenLabs
 (for celebrity-like voice synthesis)

🔑 Note: The ElevenLabs subscription is required for MP3 generation.
Without it, the workflow will still generate the script text, but the audio output will not be available.


# 📖 Why This Project?

This project combines:

Automation (n8n) → orchestrating multiple AI services.

NLP (AI script generation) → making academic content engaging.

Speech synthesis (ElevenLabs) → turning text into lively narration.

It demonstrates practical skills in AI integration, workflow automation, and creative problem-solving, while also being fun and memorable.


# 🔮 Future Improvements

Replace ElevenLabs with an open-source TTS engine for free usage.

Add a front-end interface for choosing celebrity voices on demand.

Expand outputs to video (with captions + background visuals).
